**MemeAdviser** is a reddit bot that analyzes the market at [r/MemeEconomy](https://www.reddit.com/r/MemeEconomy) and gives insightful information.

### Features
#### Logs the front page
As soon as a post hits #1 on [the front page](https://www.reddit.com/r/MemeEconomy/hot), it records the time it took and the amount of upvotes with which it reached there. Everything it's collected and recorded can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/u/MemeAdviser/comments).

#### Posts promising memes to r/InsiderMemeTrading
If the post has a low number of upvotes at the time, it posts the link to [r/InsiderMemeTrading](https://www.reddit.com/r/InsiderMemeTrading) and provides the break-even point for any investment made during that time. These can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/u/MemeAdviser/posts).

#### Subscriptions
The bot lets users subscribe to it. When it finds a promising meme, it messages the link to everyone that's subscribed. It also provides a more in-depth analysis of the meme. Currently, redditors can subscribe to the bot by sending a private message to [u/MemeAdviser](https://reddit.com/u/MemeAdviser) with the text "Subscribe" as the subject and body.

### Coming Soon
You can expect many more features to come, including:
 - [x] ~~Calculating the current break-even point of an investment when it is summoned with ```!breakeven```~~
 - [ ] Monitoring more of the front page (like top 5 or top 10 on hot)
 - [ ] ~~Allowing users to ```!watch``` a post, which will send updates to the user for the next 4 hours~~
 - [ ] Automatically updating the formula the [official](https://github.com/MemeInvestor/memeinvestor_bot/blob/master/src/formula.py) one
