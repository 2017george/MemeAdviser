**MemeAdviser** is a reddit bot that analyzes the market at [r/MemeEconomy](https://www.reddit.com/r/MemeEconomy) and gives insightful information.

### Features
As soon as a post hits #1 on [the front page](https://www.reddit.com/r/MemeEconomy/hot), it records the time it took and the amount of upvotes with which it reached there. It then it posts the link to [r/InsiderMemeTrading](https://www.reddit.com/r/InsiderMemeTrading) and provides the break-even point for any investment made during that time.

### Coming Soon
You can expect many more features to come, including:
 - [ ] Calculating the current break-even point of an investment when it is summoned with ```!breakeven```
 - [ ] Monitoring more of the front page (like top 5 or top 10 on hot)
 - [ ] Automatically updating the formula to the [official](https://github.com/MemeInvestor/memeinvestor_bot/blob/master/src/formula.py) one
